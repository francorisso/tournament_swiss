##Creating Your Database

Before you can run your code or create your tables, you'll need to use the create database command in psql to create the database. Use the name **tournament** for your database.

Then you can connect psql to your new database and create your tables from the statements you've written in tournament.sql. You can do this in either of two ways:

Paste each statement in to psql.

Use the command \i tournament.sql to import the whole file into psql at once.
